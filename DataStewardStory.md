# Data Steward Console – STAR

S – Situation:
- In October 2024, Celigo was preparing for a critical Gartner demo.
- Leadership decided to build a brand-new Data Steward Console - a completely new dashboard designed to give users visibility into integration and flow errors via interactive visualizations and graphs.
- This dashboard had to be feature-rich (graphs, drill-downs, filters), built from scratch, and aligned with a new design system (ShadCN + Tailwind).
- The company goal was to release a quick MVP, but I believed we could build a polished, scalable version within the same timeline.

T - Task
- I was the only frontend engineer with bandwidth, and leadership asked me to own the feature end-to-end.
- The feature involved building complex visualizations (e.g., Exceptions by Assignee, Tags, Age, Workflows, etc.), and I had no prior experience in developing such interactive dashboards.
- Backend APIs weren’t designed for visualizations, and we had no dedicated QA or design-system support.
- I needed to deliver this by end-of-November, just in time for the internal Gartner preview — with changing UX inputs and backend limitations.

A - Action
- I took initiative and set up tri-weekly syncs with PMs, UX designers, engineering managers, and the backend team.
- Since many backend APIs were not ready to use, I reverse-engineered them to extract usable data and built all UI graphs using creative frontend logic.
- I proposed a plan to PMs: ship a working version quickly, then layer in the new design system alignment within 3–4 days — UX team backed this, and I worked with the NDS team to finalize designs.
- I learned new libraries for charts and drill-down interactions, handling complex state and data transformations.
- Despite last-minute UX changes, I kept turnaround time to 2–3 hours for feedback loops — surprising even my managers.
- I did complete end-to-end testing myself and coordinated with backend engineers to ensure data consistency.
- When backend bandwidth was tight or misaligned, I handled conflicts with 1:1 calls, clarified urgency, and proposed phased delivery.

R - Result
- Delivered the entire dashboard solo, fully aligned with the new design system, on time for the Gartner demo.
- The dashboard significantly improved exception tracking efficiency and reduced manual efforts.
- It was highly praised by directors, PMs, and the UX team.
- This experience transformed my mindset — I moved from hesitation to confidence, learned to lead through ambiguity. This has been a great learning experience

**Biggest challenge / hurdle**
Your fear of the unknown, imposter syndrome, and how your manager’s support helped you transform.

**Proudest project / biggest impact**
The technical scope, solo delivery, stakeholder management, and Gartner demo outcome.

**Leadership without authority**
You drove syncs, aligned teams, and made decisions without being told what to do.

**Handling conflict / difficult teammate**     
Backend collaboration issues and how you proactively resolved them

**Taking initiative**                          
How you proposed a phased plan, engaged with the design system team, and self-tested everything.  

**Receiving feedback**                         
How UX changes came in late, and how you responded constructively with fast turnaround.           

**Time management / juggling priorities**      
Balancing graphs, design system integration, backend constraints, and rapid iterations.           

**Handling ambiguity**                         
Working without full APIs, learning new UI libraries, and driving forward without clear precedents. 

**Working under pressure / missing deadlines** 
Prevented delays by restructuring plans and openly communicating trade-offs.                      

**Solving a customer pain point**              
How the dashboard solved real user challenges around exception visibility and resolution.         

**Dealing with changing priorities**           
Last-minute UX changes and backend limitations — you adapted rapidly and delivered.               

**Quality focus**                              
Full manual testing, creative API usage, and delivering a stable feature without QA support.      


### Describe a positive leadership or managerial style you liked from one of your previous managers. How did it influence your work style?
One Thursday evening, just as I was about to log off, my manager called me and shared a mockup of a visually rich dashboard — the Data Steward Console, filled with graphs and drill-downs. At first, I thought it was a performance dashboard, but he told me I’d be building it. I had never worked on such a complex, design-intensive UI feature from scratch, and I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety.

The project involved building this dashboard solo, from scratch, using a new design system and advanced UI elements. I had very little context or experience with such interactive features, and we were about to leave for a planned UI team trip to Goa that weekend.

While we were sitting on a beach that Sunday, he casually asked if I was excited about the project. I told him I was, but also felt unsure where to even start. He responded with something that really stuck with me: “It’s normal. You’re not supposed to know everything on day one — just believe in yourself. This is just code. You’ll figure it out.”

He didn’t pressure me, but instead gave me confidence and connected me with a senior engineer who could guide me on the graph libraries. That early emotional support and trust helped me shift from self-doubt to focused learning.

That moment changed my mindset. I took full ownership of the feature, drove alignment with stakeholders, handled backend limitations, and delivered the dashboard for a key Gartner demo — solo. His calm, empowering leadership style taught me that it’s okay to feel uncertain at first — what matters is persistence, asking for help, and growing through the process. That’s now a core part of how I approach unfamiliar challenges and support others on my team.



S
- October 2024, Celigo was preparing for a critical Gartner demo.
- build data steward for efficient error tracking across all flows and integrations
- built from scratch

T
- Leadership wanted me to own the feature E2E
- no prior experience in build animated graphs and dashboards
- No dedicated BE apis to support the live data for graphs
- i understood the requirement and got the data ready for graphs using existing APIS

A
- took init, setup tri weekly calls with PM, BE, UX
- learnt working on new libraries for graphs and minor computations
- The company goal was to release a quick feature with comprimising the design consistency
- Mid way through project, i believed we could align feature with NDS in given time.
- I proposed this idea, UX backed this and ready to provide us the designs
- we delivered the working feature initially as per plan
- then took 2-4 day to align it with NDS
- UX gave last minute reviews which got done and deployed in 2-3 hours - suprise for PM and UX

R
- Delivered the dashboard aligned with NDS on time
- Got good rating
- highly praised by PMs and directors
- changed my mindset from hesitation to confidence and lead the feature through ambiguity
