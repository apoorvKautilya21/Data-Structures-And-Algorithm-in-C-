🧩 1. Architecture & Design Decisions
QQQQQ. How did you architect the dashboard layout and components?
“I started by identifying the key functional sections from the UX design — like Total Exceptions, Exceptions by Assignee, Tags, Age, Workflow Errors, and Applications. I broke the dashboard into logical, reusable components, following a grid-based layout for consistency.”
“Each section was built as a standalone card component, which allowed me to encapsulate logic, loading state, empty state, and error handling. I also used a responsive flex/grid system with Tailwind classes to make the layout adapt to different screen sizes.”
“Charts like bar, pie, and donut were abstracted into chart wrapper components, each of which accepted configurable props (data, labels, onClick handlers, etc.), so the logic was reusable across the dashboard.”
“Since the dashboard was built to support drill-downs, I kept layout lightweight and modular to avoid re-renders of unrelated sections. This made the dashboard both scalable and easy to test or update as new exception types or metrics are added.”



QQQQQ. How did you structure the state management for multiple charts and drill-downs?
“State management was a key consideration, especially since the dashboard had global filters (like date range and flow selection) and local state for individual charts and drill-downs.”
“I used React's context + reducer pattern to manage global filters at the dashboard level. This allowed child components to subscribe to shared state without prop-drilling. Whenever a global filter changed, it triggered data re-fetching for all relevant cards.”
“Each chart component managed its local UI state — like loading, expanded view, or selected drill-down tab — using local useState or useReducer, depending on complexity.”
“To handle drill-downs, I designed a shared 'Selected Context' — a structure that stored the chart’s context (e.g., 'P1 Errors > Flow X > User Y'), which allowed me to sync data across components while preserving isolation.”
“Memoization and lazy-loading were used to optimize performance, so charts didn’t re-render unnecessarily when other unrelated state changed.”



Why did you choose to use [Tailwind/ShadCN/Charting library]? What alternatives did you consider?

How did you ensure the dashboard was modular and maintainable?

How did you organize the visual hierarchy across graphs and metrics?

⚡ 2. Performance Optimization
How did you ensure the dashboard was performant, especially with multiple data visualizations?

Did you lazy-load any parts of the dashboard?

How did you manage re-renders when filters or tabs changed?

How did you handle large data sets in the graphs — any pagination or sampling strategy?

🖼️ 3. Visualizations & Charts
Which charting library did you use and why?

How did you implement drill-down interactions across charts?

How did you handle edge cases like no data, API failures, or inconsistent values?

What accessibility or responsiveness considerations did you apply to the graphs?

Did you build reusable chart components? How did you manage prop/state complexity?

🧠 4. Data Handling & API Strategy
Did you face any challenges working with unstructured or raw backend data?

How did you manage API calls — batching, debounce, caching?

How did you fetch and update data for actions like retry, assign, or resolve?

How did you map complex data structures into a UI-friendly format for charts and summaries?

🎨 5. Design System & Consistency
How did you ensure consistency with the new ShadCN + Tailwind-based design system?

Did you work with a design system team? What kind of coordination was needed?

What challenges did you face migrating from Material UI to Tailwind components?

🧪 6. Testing & Reliability
What kind of UI testing did you do? Manual, unit, integration?

How did you handle testing in the absence of QA support?

How did you test user flows involving graphs, filters, and backend actions?

🤝 7. Collaboration & Product Thinking
How did you work with the UX team during evolving designs?

What user problems were you trying to solve, and how did the UI reflect those needs?

How did you collect feedback and iterate on the UI?

Were there any usability improvements you proposed on your own?
