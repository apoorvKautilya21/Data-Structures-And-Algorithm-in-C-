S
- UI loading time for connection form was very high
- we were making unnecessary api call to get low volume of data
- led to rerenders
- bad UX

T
- I was assigned a spike to look into it
- I suggested BE response changes 
- after which UI will not be making unnecessary api calls
- Collaborated with BE and make them understand the requirements

A
- While I completed my UI development on time, backend changes kept getting delayed.
- They under evaluated the efforts required for the changes and not very prompt in updating the dates
- handled the conflict with a 1:1 call with the engineer, understood their workload
- got continuous follow ups from QA and EM
- I communicated that the scope was not fully under my control
- Scheduled a call with PM, re prioritised projects.
- Then proposed a plan in case of delay, we can either go for next release or go for patch, which relaxed the QA team.
- I self-tested all use cases thoroughly, made sure the feature comes with 0 bugs

R
- We delivered the feature on time with 0 bugs.
- loading time decreased
- Learned working with teammate in case of a conflict
