Hi, my name is Apoorv, and I’m currently a Frontend Engineer at Celigo. Over the past 2 years, I’ve been working on building scalable and interactive user interfaces at Celigo with a team of talented folks based all over India.

I come from an Electrical and Electronics Engineering background, but during college, I developed a keen interest for software development, it fascinated me how a piece of code can build such fascinating things. I interned at Celigo for 6 months during my college which gave me a hands on experience on UI.

I converted this opportunity to a full time offer. As an full time engineer at Celigo, I became part of this high performance and dynamic team. This gave me an opportunity to define processes, best practices, take ownership. My key projects are Data steward console, performance improvement, Integrated universal logo upload functionality.

Lastly, outside of work I have a passion for playing cricket, going to gym. I’m eager to bring the same curiosity, creativity, and energy to Google, and I’m really excited to have this conversation today!
