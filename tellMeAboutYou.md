Hi, my name is Apoorv, a Frontend Engineer at Celigo with a strong track record of building high-performance, scalable web applications. Over the past 2 years, I’ve worked on building efficient & interactive error tracking dashboard, leading component architecture, handling performance optimizations, and even driving large-scale design system migrations from Material UI to Tailwind/ShadCN.

I come from an Electrical and Electronics Engineering background, but during college, I developed a keen interest for software development, it fascinated me how a piece of code can build such fascinating things. I interned at Celigo for 6 months during my college which gave me a hands on experience on UI.

I converted this opportunity to a full time offer. As an full time engineer at Celigo, I became part of this high performance and dynamic team. This gave me an opportunity to define processes, best practices, take ownership.

Lastly, outside of work I have a passion for playing cricket, going to gym.
I feel ready to broaden my skill set, especially by gaining more exposure to backend systems, architecture, and full-stack development that have a real impact on millions of users.
That’s why I’m exploring roles at Google — it’s a place known for engineering excellence, cross functional growth opportunities.
